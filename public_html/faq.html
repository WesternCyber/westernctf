                            <p> Western Cyber Security aims to educate students on methods and strategies to
                                ethical hacking. Our club was inspired by a group of students who were
                                interested in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and wanted to create a
                                program to learn more about hacking.<br>

                                We regularly organize teams to compete at international competitions, host
                                workshops by researchers in the Cyber Security and hold networking events to
                                connect students with the corporate space.

                            <p> CTFs, or Capture the Flag, are global competitions where teams race each
                                other to obtain a certain goal by completing reverse engineering tasks or
                                simply exploiting holes in software and servers.

                        <div class="content">
                            <p> There are two types of CTFs, one being jeopardy style CTF where teams have a
                                grid on available tasks and their worth (in points). As we complete tasks,
                                we are rewarded points. The team with most points win. The second type is
                                attack/defend which is where each team is given a server to protect and is
                                expected to take down other teamâ€™s servers.
