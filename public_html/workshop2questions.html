            <h4>CTFs are security challenges hosted by many Security Companies and Higher-level learning institutions. The purpose of CTFs is to provide a closed environment where students and industry professionals alike can practice attacking and defending skills used in the security field.</h4>
            <h4>The official CTF website is at <a href="http://www.ctftime.org/" target="_blank">Ctftime.org</a> You can find a listing of past and upcoming CTFs as well as writeups(solutions) for ctf questions.</h4>
            <h4>CTFs are split into two types: <span style="color:red">Attack and Defense</span>, and <span style="color:orange">Jeopardy</span></h4>
            <h4 style="color:red">Attack and Defense: Every team has their own server or network. They are responsible for patching up their own vulnerable services while trying to find exploits in other teams' services. This is the classic CTF type.</h4>
            <h4 style="color:orange">Jeopardy: There will be a list of questions in fields such as Cryptography, Forensics, Web, Exploit, etc. and over a 2-3 day timespan, teams compete in trying to solve these challenges as quickly as possible.</h4>

            <h3 class="uppercase mb80">We have prepared a mini Jeopardy style ctf for you guys. Try to find the flag in each of these challenges.<br> Flags are in flag{} format unless otherwise specified.</h3>
